    Most functionality is described in the methods and properties you have
    to override for subclasses.  A special notice applies for user
    registration.

    Different auth systems may create users at different stages (first login,
    register etc.).  At that point (where the user is created in the
    database) the system has to call `after_register` and pass it the user
    (and request) object.  That method handles the confirmation mails and
    whatever else is required.  If you do not want your auth system to send
    confirmation mails you still have to call the method but tell the user
    of your class to disable registration activation in the configuration.

    `after_register` should *not* be called if the registration process
    should happen transparently for the user.  eg, the user has already
    registered somewhere else and the Solace account is created based on the
    already existing account on first login.
